The Isley Brothers Lyrics
"For The Love Of You"

Yeah, well, well, well
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey

Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Then with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well

Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candle lights
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well

Glad to be here alone
With a lover unlike no other
Sad to see a new horizon
Slowly comin' into view, yeah

I wanna be living for the love of you
Ah, yes I am
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Alright now

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the mornin' comes
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me, well

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be, well
When you're lovin' me
When you're lovin' me

Love to be right in the waves
Of your love enchanted with a touch
And it seems to me
We could sail together
In and out of mystery

Well, I wanna be living, for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving, is for the love of you
You got me, girl

I wanna be living, for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving, givin' is for the love of you
Oh, yes I am

Paradise I have within
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key
Well, and this I see
Oh, I see

Now and then I lose my way
Using words that try to say
What I feel, yeah, love is real
Oh, love is real

I might as well sign my name
On a card which could say it better
Time will tell 'cause it seems
That I done just about all that I can do

I know that I'm livin', for the love of you
Oh, yes I am
I know that I'm livin', for the love, love of you
Every, everyday I, livin', for the love of you

I'm living, for the love
Each and every day, oh yes I do
I'm gonna say it one more time

Said, "I'm living, for the love
Each and every day, oh"
Lord, Lord knows I am right, right now
Said that, "I'm livin' for the love"
